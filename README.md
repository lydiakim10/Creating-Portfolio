# HW-2

## Description
Creating a portfolio that is accessible and legible is crucial when applying for a full-time or part-time position in any coding-related career. A portfolio will emphasize the strengths of a coder and the skillsets that a coder can bring to the team/company. This project allows me to create my own portfolio that provides a description about myself, show my recent projects and resume, and gives any contact information to the chosen readers. Throughout the course, this portfolio will be updated with various deployed projects and other useful information that will ultimately, and hopefully, land me a full-time position in a coding path.
